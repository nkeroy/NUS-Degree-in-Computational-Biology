Details on what to expect when studying Computational Biology in NUS

I have recently "unofficially" graduated from the National University of Singapore
as a result of overloading modules in my earlier terms of study. Having a bit of free
time to spare and some inspiration from a junior in Computational Biology
credits to Xuan Lim's introduction to NUS Computational Biology: https://github.com/HayashiEsme/NUS-Unofficial-Comp-Bio-Guide), this write-up
is for mainly undergraduates in the Computational Biology course offered by Faculty 
of Science, however it can be also used as a benchmark for incoming students as what to
expect out of this demanding course.

Computational Biology encompasses various fields of biology. The essence of this
course is to utilise biological data to build algorithms and models, so that we can 
understand biological systems and their corresponding relationships. The "computational"
in this course comes in the building of these algorithms and models, which is also
why I often tell people that our course is a double study of computer science and 
biology, just that it's crammmed into a single major. While prospective students
might be turned off at perhaps their lack of aptitude towards computer science, 
the assurance is that the computer science knowledge required is not as in depth as the requirement in a pure computer science course (just some basic data structures/algorithms, an understanding of
machine learning etc). However, due to the intensive nature of this course, there're only a few electives allocated that you could take for flexible learning.

Given a limited number of modules for electives, a question you might ask at this
point in time is, should I have a strong concentration on either biology, computer science
or both? My answer to this is, it depends on your interests, but more importantly what
you plan to do in the future. In light of academia, courses in computational biology
are mostly designed in a way to facilitate students for transition into higher studies
i.e Masters/PhD, as a result you may have noticed that the NUS computational biology 
course have requirements that balance the nature of the modules that you take, so that
students can be somewhat considered as an all-rounder (in a good way). 
If you plan to go into academia, a good mixture of both concentrations would be great. 
However, if you plan to venture into the working world, my advice is to take more 
computational modules from the Department of Computer Science, such as those relating 
to AI and Machine Learning. In the era of "Big Data", it's a great opportunity to learn 
in these fields so as to have a edge over future Science graduates.

In addition, I would urge current students in the course to really explore the different 
aspects of computational biology. There are various fields that you could actually try
applying what you have learnt in the course (it's not only restricted to genomic analysis
and phylogenetic trees). For my final year project, I undertook a project on pharmacokinetic
in-silico modelling of drugs for which I get to apply the knowledge that I have accumulated
throughout the duration of the course. Other coursemates have their projects in molecular
and cellular imaging algorithms, building pipeline for single cell RNA analysis and
discovering function of protein domain. Some projects are computationally intensive and
you actually have to write programs and do testing, while others may involve some wet lab work
and the usage of available softwares for analysis. However, you do not have to
wait until the final year to start thinking of what you want to do. There are UROPS
projects available for NUS students (research projects which you can try out research
with a supervising professor) that you can have a taste of what it's like to do research
in a certain topic. While computational biology do not update UROPS project in the UROPS
portal, a good suggestion would be to search for professors whose research areas are
aligned with your interests. If you require any help for searching, feel free to
drop me an email and I will do my best to advise you. Alternatively, the best way is
to consult the coordinators for the computationally biology course and they will
do their best to help you.

For now, this would be the end of my write-up. If I ever receive any questions or feedback, I may add in new content to make this a better guide.
